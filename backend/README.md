# ApostropheCMS Backend

This is the backend portion of the ApostropheCMS + Astro hybrid demo.

## Running the Backend

For installation and setup instructions, see the [main README](../README.md) at the project root.
```bash
# From this directory
npm run dev
```

## Learning More About the Backend

This backend is based on the [ApostropheCMS public-demo](https://github.com/apostrophecms/public-demo) repository. For detailed documentation about the backend architecture, content modeling patterns, and ApostropheCMS-specific features, refer to that repository.

The main differences in this version are the removal of frontend templates (replaced by Astro components) and the addition of the `@apostrophecms/apostrophe-astro` integration.
